    "description": "Working at Cardano was an incredible and humbling experience, getting to work with some incredible minds building out highly complex software to help make important financial decisions. Testing became second nature, with critical peer reviewed pull requests as the standard. I learned a phenomenal amount from the team, both technical and non-technical, about requirement gathering, proposing architecture, establishing CI/CD pipelines and definitions of done before the developing and testing could even begin."

The role was making front-end fixes for their European sites in the run-up to the release of the iPhones X and 8 in 2017 and included a trip to Silicon Valley for the launch itself."
